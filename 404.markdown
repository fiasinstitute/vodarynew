MIDWAY upon the journey of our life<br>
— I found myself within a forest dark,<br>
— For the straightforward pathway had been lost.<br>
Ah me! how hard a thing it is to say<br>
— ⁠What was this forest savage, rough, and stern,<br>
— Which in the very thought renews the fear.<br>
So bitter is it, death is little more;<br>
— But of the good to treat, which there I found,<br>
⁠— Speak will I of the other things I saw there.<br>
I cannot well repeat how there I entered,<br>
— So full was I of slumber at the moment<br>
⁠— In which I had abandoned the true way.<br>
