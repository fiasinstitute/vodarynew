title: First and Last Things & God the Invisible King
resume: In these two works, the renowned English writer H.G.Wells, one of the “fathers of science fiction”, covers philosohical questions. In the first one, “First and Last Things”, the author analyzes the reliability of the senses and the mind in the business of perception. This analysis leads him to the assertion of his most comprehensive beliefs. Those conciliate so fiercely incommensurable views as the practical solipsism of Max Stirner and the kenosis asceticism of the Slavophiles (a.k.a. “sobornost”). He transfigures basic biological and Christian motivations to produce extensive guidelines on warfare, sex and marriage relations, life, death and God. The relation between the society and the Latter is the subject of the second book, “God the Invisibla King”. The labours of H.G.Wells foreran many intellectual developments of the XX century, e.g. the Mamleyev's Metaphysical Circle&#58; Mamleyev, Sapgir, Yerofeyev, Dzhemal.
